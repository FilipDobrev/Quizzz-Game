## How to run it

 - Installing the game on Windows:

1. Download the latest version of Java, JavaFX and Gradle
2. Go to the oopp-group-50 repository and clone the main branch on your system from the clone button(make sure you have a SSH key):
 - Using a terminal go to the directory where you want to clone it and write "git clone //address//"
3. Open the `repository-template` folder and write "gradle build" in the terminal
4. After the process has finished, write "gradle run", this will run the server
5. You can open the `repository-template` folder in an IDE like IntelliJ, Eclipse etc.
6. From there if you haven't stopped the server, you can just find the "Main" in the client and run it (`client/src/main/java/client/Main.java`)
7. If the server is not running you can start it from the "Main" on the server side (`server/src/main/java/server/Main.java`)


 - Adding the images:

Download the latest release of the activity bank zip file.
After unzipping the file you should rename the folder to "Activity-Images".
Then, move the folder to "client/src/main/resources/images/".

 - Adding the database:

After adding the images you will find a json file called activities.json in the following directory: "client/src/main/resources/images/".
Move this json file to the following directory: "server/src/main/resources/"
Then you can start the server and make a GET request using Postman to the following url:"http://localhost:8080/api/activities/updateJsonFile".
This will automatically populate the database.


_**Enjoy, now you can play the game!**_
