**Code of Conduct**

**In a Code of Conduct you discuss with each other what you expect from each other and from the collaboration. Everyone participates in this and supports the agreements that you draw up together. A Code of Conduct is a flexible document. If after some time it appears that certain agreements are not realistic or applicable, then it is important to discuss this in the group and adjust the agreements if necessary.**

**Assignment description:**

In your own words, describe what you need to do as a group in this course.

**Synchronizing our activities and organizing tasks. We need to hold deadlines and submit quality work. We need to work as a team and focus on getting better at working together. We should have in person meetings in regular intervals, if possible. Specifically for the project, we will be implementing a multiplayer quiz game to raise awareness on green and sustainable energy resources. We would like to create an environment where the users can have fun with the excitement of competing for the highest score on the leaderboard while learning the significance of energy management.**

**Target or ambition level:**

What grade are you working for?

**We wish to have a hand-on experience on a real software development project. Not only do we aim to learn software design and the coding behind the project but also aim to have an intuition about being a team and working collaboratively. Although we thrive for a high grade, we set our goal to 7 and are excited to push it forward.**

**Products:**

What should you deliver at the end? On which platform do you share which documents (Discourse/Miro/MS Teams)? What standards must the work submitted meet?

**We deliver a fully working game, in accordance with the needed features (as seen in our Backlog). We share documents mainly on GitLab, and Discord. The work submitted must meet the HCI standards when uploaded, and when shared on GitLab, draft versions can be shared on Discord.**

**Planning:**

How do you ensure that each group finishes everything on time? Did you clarify who will have a final say in the final deliverable and submits it to Brightspace *on behalf of the project group?*

**We are going to have “pre-deadlines”, when the group will check on the progress. Pre deadlines are set to be one day before the actual deadline. In case of crucial features, we can decide during a meeting, that the pre-deadline will be set to be sooner, to allow for a longer “buffer period”.**

**We need a consensus on the final deliverable. Filip submits the final deliverable on behalf of the project group. Also, while we are splitting the tasks we will take into account the difficulty, time it requires and the similarity of the task compared to the previous ones. We will ensure everyone participates in the project in various aspects and experiences every step of the process. For the procedure we will vote on the distribution of the tasks while considering the personal preferences and specialities.**

**Behavior:**

How do you treat each other in the group? How do you handle disagreements within your group? Could your guide or student assistant be involved in reaching consent? What do you do if someone is late during a group meeting?

**We are open about our boundaries and the way we would like to be treated. As a team, we pledge to create a non-discriminating environment. In our group, no type of harassment is tolerated, regardless of cultural differences, ethnicity, religion, physical aspects, education, work experience or beliefs. Everyone shall contribute to maintaining an inclusive, welcoming** **work environment and also to encouraging good cooperation between team members, without losing our objectives as a team from sight.**

**We discuss disagreements in a civilized way, by discussing the differences between conflicting parties within the team. Every point of conflict shall be addressed and decided upon within the team in accordance with the decision making process described below.**

**in cases this is ddifficult we ask a neutral third-party to moderate the discussion. (This neutral third party can of course be our guide or student assistant, for example). In case of lateness (if it is not for a good reason), we verbally warn the late person, who of course heeds this warning as it is in everyone’s best interest not to sabotage our teamwork. In case of excessive anti-group behavior (for example repeated lateness with no good reason), we alert our guide/student assistant.**

**Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our team:**

- **Being kind and empathetic to others**
- **Being respectful of each others’ opinions**
- **Giving and accepting constructive feedback**
- **Accepting responsibility and apologizing for our mistakes; learning from mistakes**
- **Focusing on what is best for the team**

**Examples of unacceptable behavior include:**

- **Malicious/disruptive behavior; such as trolling, or intentionally harming the process; with exception of trolling inside the therefore designed text channel in discord called "trolling"**
- **Harassment of team members**
- **Non-professional behavior**

**Communication:**

In what ways do you communicate with each other as a group and among yourselves? (in the studio/MS Teams/Miro/Discourse)

**We use Discord for online communication, and we meet in person and talk in person in case we believe that is needed.**

**Commitment:**

How do you determine the quality of each group's work, so that each group delivers the same quality? How do you measure the commitment of the chairs and minute takers?

**We will have a 2 -man code review policy, so that any submitted work will be checked by at least 2 people. Also, for major changes we will ask for the approval of 4 people. During the tips and tops phase, we can all review the commitment of the chairs and minute takers.**

**The reviewed code should adhere to the following guidelines:**

- **The code should be formatted according to our checkstyle format.**
- **The code should achieve the task it was meant to.**
- **The program should still be able to run after merging the code.**
- **The code should be properly documented and commented on.**

**Meetings:**

How often will you meet as a group? What preparation is needed for the meetings?

**We have extra meetings every Thursday. We choose the chair and the secretary, and the chair creates the agenda (he may need to consult other people). If the agenda contains topics needing proper preparation, the agenda will clearly state what needs to be prepared.**

**In case we are close to a deadline and have some challenge we need to discuss, we might decide on extra meetings by checking our weekly schedule and our progress compared to the calendar. For the procedure, we will vote on the meeting if we are going to have them and if so when. The meetings are flexible in order to adhere to our busy schedule.**

**Decision-making:**

How do you make decisions? By majority vote or by consensus?

**For important decisions, we need a qualified majority (5 people). For minor decisions a simple majority (4 people) is sufficient.**

**Everyone has to comply with the decisions made by the group.**

**Dealing with conflicts:**

How do you handle conflicts within the group?

**We discuss disagreements civilly; an agenda point will be made concerning the conflict where the above described decision-making method will be used to resolve the conflict.**

**In cases this is difficult we ask a neutral third-party to moderate the discussion. (This neutral third party can of course be our guide or student assistant, for example).**

**Guidance:**

What do you expect from the teacher's and/or student assistant’s guidance? What do you want feedback on, on the content or on the collaboration?

**We expect guidance in case we are stuck. We hope we get clarifications during the early assignments in case the text is not clear.**

**We hope we can get feedback on both the product and the process; we hope to improve as a team in both aspects.**

**Consequences:**

What are the consequences if a participant in the group does not keep the agreements?

**If the “breach” is justified (as in the original agreement is not feasible), we might change the agreements. In case the breach is not severe, we will all ask the offender to be more careful in the future; in case of repeated or severe breach, we report the individual to the course coordinators.**

**Succesfactors:**

What makes your team a dream team?

**We are all motivated to learn, and interested in the project itself; this will make us all put in enough work to make everything go smoothly (we also have the coolest meeting place in the EWI building**  **).**
