Agenda items 

Opening by Chairperson 
“Can I take my laptop, it will take just 2 minutes.”


Announcements 
No announcements were discussed.

Approval of the agenda 
(Does anyone have any additions to the agenda? what is missing that you would like to discuss?)
No approval of the agenda points.

Approve minutes of prior meeting
We did not go over the minutes of prior meetings.

[Agenda item 1] 
Code of Conduct – Are we still on track? Do we need to make adjustments?

For the goal we should write a description of the product.

[Agenda item 2]
Feedback Backlog

Weights are good but we need to add an explanation of what the weights are supposed to symbolize and add it to GitLab. The explanation should just be a few sentences.

We should have filled in all the milestones for the whole project by next week. (milestones == scrum sprint backlog).

Good use of labels.
Some descriptions are not good enough. More breaking down issues.
We should fix issues as we go.

[Agenda item 3]
API endpoints

By Friday we must implement at least one API endpoint.
For example, create a get method on the spring server side. And it should work on postman.

For next week 4 endpoints should be implemented (recommended for Friday).
Get, put, post and delete.

[Agenda item 4]
Good Gitlab practices

1 branch per issue per feature,
Issues should include the user story and description
We should have a checklist for what needs to be done to complete an issue.
We could also add solutions to issues in description.
All issues should be labeled.
We should utilize the issues board .

Merge request: 
-	Before pushing run check style.
-	Everyone should review merge requests
-	2 approvers per merge request
Code reviews:
-	Pull and test functionally
-	Are the test working?
-	Is it not working -> write comments in the merge request. (MANDATORY)
-	These comments need to be specific
-	No comments like “Good job”
-	Reply to comments on GITLAB not in DISCORD
-	It is fine to discuss reviews in meeting but document them in Gitlab
-	Not the same 2 persons approving every time.

-	Approval of agenda.
-	Approval of minutes of prior meetings.


Dragos: Nice that we are working on schedule
But please add “approval of agenda” topic.

Filip: nice that we do meetings often and are on schedule.
Now let’s start making progress and make real steps

Orhan: I like the energy; we are communicating well.
We can be more active socially while communicating in the meetings, a nicer social energetic environment. Could be more informal.

If there are any important announcements, you can take minutes.
We skipped over further questions because we were late.
