# **Role of Secretary**

The secretary is responsible for taking notes during the meeting but also helps the chair with preparing and following up on action items. In addition, the secretary is responsible for communication with team members and the teaching assistants and for organizing documents. This means that the secretary is responsible for submitting documents to Brightspace on time.

**Tips for taking minutes**

- Prepare the meeting well, so you know the agenda items and objectives.
- Limit the minutes to what was discussed and decided in the meeting.
- Make a clear note of the actions: what the agreement entails, when the action must be carried out, and who is responsible.
- Elaborate on the notes and share with team members and/or non-team members.

Take minutes of what was decided and what actions were taken

Record (so write down) what was decided and what actions there are. You are free to take detailed notes of the entire meeting. But it can take a lot of time and is not always necessary. Therefore, it is recommended to limit yourself to the main discussed topics and to list decisions and action points. This is sufficient for keeping track of your project meetings. You can, for example, use one list that is attached at each meeting with the new decisions and/or actions. You can think of tools like Miro or Trello and such to keep track. Each decision must be accompanied by the date (i.e., during which the meeting) the decision was taken. We provide a solution for this in the template below.

One merge request by the endo f the week with code.

Commets on merge requests are needed

Issues should be divided(we should assign issues to everyone)

**Any questions?**

[16:20 – 16:30] **Question Round**

- Do we need servers for the game?

- With what should we start: back- or front-end?

**Whatever we decide**

**Difficult to connect server and client. It&#39;s the hardest part, we can connect the back end with the server. Check ServerUtils. Jakarta library, apache helicopters, java.net**

- What about inserting images in the project? + binary form

**We can add them, no problem. When concerning scenes there is no problem uplaoding images.**

- Can we change the amount of people that review a merge
- request?

**We will be more carefull now, it cannot be changed as of now.**

- Should we list all the row results? HCI assignment

**Only the most important ones, described accordingly.**

**Tenses, need to be fixed. No two different tenses in the same sentence.**

**Conclusion looks fine, final prototype needs more descroptions**

**Closing**

_No minutes_
